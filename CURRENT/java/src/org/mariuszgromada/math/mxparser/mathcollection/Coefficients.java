 * tasks. For example, the number of workstations may refer to the number
 * of software developers, engineers, architects, scientists, and other
 * professionals who use the PRODUCT on your behalf. The number of
 * workstations is not the number of copies of your end-product that you
 * distribute to your end-users.
 *
 * By purchasing the COMMERCIAL LICENSE, you only pay for the number of
 * workstations, while the number of copies of your final product
 * (delivered to your end-users) is not limited.
 *
 * UPGRADE POLICY
 *
 * The PRODUCT is versioned according to the following convention:
 *
 *    [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]
 *
 * 1. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders can install and use the updated version
 *    for bug fixes free of charge, i.e. if you have purchased a license
 *    for the [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g.: 5.0), you can freely install
 *    all the various releases specified in the [PATCH] version (e.g.: 5.0.2).
 *    The license terms remain unchanged after the update.
 * 2. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders for [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g.: 5.0)
 *    can install and use the updated version [MAJOR].[MINOR + 1] free of
 *    charge, i.e., plus one release in the [MINOR] range (e.g.: 5.1). The
 *    license terms remain unchanged after the update.
 * 3. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders who wish to upgrade their version, but are
 *    not eligible for the free upgrade, can claim a discount when
 *    purchasing the upgrade. For this purpose, please contact us via e-mail.
